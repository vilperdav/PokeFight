# Project Explanation - PokeFight

The application is based on a simulation of simple Pokémon battles based on the original games but in a more contained version.

Combat will be between a user and an intelligent agent developed specifically for the game.

In order to make the game viable, a series of restrictions and limitations must be taken:

There will be no objects that can alter the result of the game (Restore-Everything, Potions,...).
There are no special skills such as intimidation, pressure,...
There are no altered states such as burned, poisoned,…

If there will be an advantage of types over others:
- Fire > Plant
- Plant > Water
- Water > Fire

Two attacks:
- Tackle.
- Attack of the type corresponding to the pokemon.

Choosing the intelligent agent Pokémon at random.
- Pokémon Types (Initials): Water, Fire and Grass.
- Attack Types (Initial): Normal, Water, Fire and Grass.

Attack Strength:
- Normal (x1 of the pokemon's strength),
- Effective (x2 of the pokemon's strength),
- Not Effective (x0.5 of the pokemon's strength)

Stats: HP, Attack, Defense.

Pokémon changes are allowed.

Objectives to achieve:

Development of basic Pokémon combat on console (Without Intelligent Agent).
- GUI development and code adaptation.
- Incorporation of basic intelligent agent.
- Incorporation of advanced intelligent agent.
- Incorporation of medals, different types of Pokémon, shift changes, attacks,...
- The final objective of the project would be to try to win as many battles as possible and obtain medals that certify that the intelligent agent has won in combat.

Our target audience is those users who, between tasks, have 5 to 10 minutes of free time, trying to fill these gaps with a quick game of our application.
